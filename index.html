      I'm a <strong>husband</strong> and <strong>father</strong> of 4 (1 on the way). I decided to convert my basement into a reptile den. We have 5
      snakes, 6 geckos,
      2 bearded dragons, and 2 tortoises. Maybe too small of a number to be called a den?

      I <strong>LOVE</strong>
      to fiddle and tinker around with things. It drives my family crazy! I love to learn new things! I enjoy
      wondering around the hardware store and just looking at stock on the shelf and imagine the projects I could
      do. I'm a big gearhead, and love anything with a motor on it. On my birthday my wife suprised me with a track day. I was able to drive around the track in a Ferrari 488 GTB, with a professional driving instructor. <strong>WOW</strong> what a cool experience.

      I have been pretty
      steadily going to college since 2011. I used to be a mechanical engineering major. After too many credits
      and years, I was prompted by family to switch to computer science. I loved it! I was in my element,
      finacially became too overwhelming. I felt like I was paying too much money to not getting my hands fiddling on some code! 
      I have a <strong>huge</strong> drive to learn, I then went on months learning anything from the internet.
      I went down a route of learning Node.js, Angular, Swift, ios development, and many others. One of my roles I
      was part of the Business Intelligence department. I learned a lot of practical experience of how data should
      be organized and stored. I still have dreams about ER diagrams.
    </p>
    <strong>tl;dr</strong> I'm husband and father of 4. I love to code, tinker, solve puzzles and learn. I have snakes
    and other reptiles. I love anything with a motor on it (I currently have a diesel truck).
